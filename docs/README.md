# IIoT Ontology
IIoT ontology is a Knowledge graph that provides a broad view of IIoT domain. It encompasses the concerns, reference architectures, Standards, Standard Organisations, initiatives from Industrial Internet of Things perspective. This project is the result of researching several documents published by organisations that work on IIoT, research publications, information of official websites of organisations. This project intends to provide critical information about the IIoT domain in a consolidated fashion.

The data model is based on the definitions of architecture descriptions, architectural views, stakeholders and Concerns as proposed in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. The relatioship between these entities is as in the class diagram below specified in the previously mentioned document.

## Introduction
The data used is made aviailable from the IIoT repository [IIoT](https://github.com/PriyankaNanjappa/IIoT).

## Visualization
