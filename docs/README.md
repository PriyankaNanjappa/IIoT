# IIoT Ontology
IIoT ontology is a Knowledge graph that provides a broad view of IIoT domain. It encompasses the concerns, reference architectures, Standards, Standard Organisations, initiatives from Industrial Internet of Things perspective. 

## Introduction
This project is the result of researching several documents published by organisations that work on IIoT, research publications, information of official websites of organisations. This project intends to provide critical information about the IIoT domain in a consolidated fashion and thereby reducing the efforts needed to understand the aspects.

The data model is based on the definitions of architecture descriptions, architectural views, stakeholders and Concerns as proposed in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010. The relatioship between these entities is as in the class diagram below specified in the previously mentioned document.

The data used is made aviailable from the IIoT repository [IIoT](https://github.com/PriyankaNanjappa/IIoT).


## Visualization
1. Architecture frameworks for IIoT

Several organisations that work on IIoT have their own reference architectures that represent an IIoT system.
There are around 20 such architectures identified in this project. The [list] The [list] (https://i40-tools.github.io/StandardOntologyVisualization/views/matrix_fw_concern.html) provides a visualization.
